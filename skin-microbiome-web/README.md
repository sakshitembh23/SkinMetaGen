Skin Microbiome Metagenomic Analysis App

This web app allows users to upload raw sequencing data (FASTQ/FASTA) for skin microbiome analysis. It runs a metagenomic pipeline (QC, trimming, MetaPhlAn, assembly, Bowtie, binning, Kraken2) and generates a detailed report with personalized food suggestions.

Quick Start:
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py
3. Upload your raw sequence files and view/download the report.

Note: This is a prototype. The analysis pipeline and report generation are currently mocked for demonstration. Integration with real tools is planned for future versions.
